# Unit_Converter

## Description
This is my first ever project. It is a simple unit converter with a text menu. This project was created to work on git skills.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

Make sure you have Python 3.13 installed.
